ExpandTheRoom (ETR) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of team members in any form.

This code of conduct applies to our interactions in various areas of our shared professional lives, including the ETR offices, off-site company events, our Slack and email exchanges, social media, pull request feedback, and industry conferences or other events where we represent ETR.

We created it not because we anticipate bad behavior, but because we believe that articulating our values and obligations to one another reinforces the already exceptional level of respect among the team and because having a code provides us with clear avenues to correct our culture should it ever stray from that course. To our team, we commit to enforce and evolve this code as our team grows.
