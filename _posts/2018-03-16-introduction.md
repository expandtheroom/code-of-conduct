ExpandtheRoom (ETR) strives to be a place where all people - regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship status, race, or religion - can collaborate to solve interesting problems and create amazing products that make a positive impact in the lives of their users. 

In pursuit of this ideal, we have created a code of conduct to govern our interactions in the various areas of our shared professional lives. This includes the ExpandTheRoom offices and coworking spaces, off-site company events, Slack and email exchanges, social media, pull request feedback, and industry conferences or other events where we represent ETR.

Itâ€™s important to note that we did not create this code because we anticipate negative behavior. We created it because we believe that articulating our values and obligations to one another reinforces the already exceptional level of respect among the team, and because having a code provides us with clear avenues to correct our culture should it ever stray from that course.
