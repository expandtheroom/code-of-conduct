ExpandTheRoom (ETR) is a team of the best people. We are professional and respect each other always. We strive to be a place where everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, citizenship status, race, or religion, can collaborate to solve problems and produce amazing results that make a positive impact in the lives of our clients and their users.

In pursuit of this ideal, we have created a code of conduct to govern our interactions in the various areas of our shared professional lives. This includes the ExpandTheRoom offices and coworking spaces, home offices, off-site company events, Slack, video conferences, email exchanges, social media, pull request feedback, industry events, and any situation where you, as an employee of ETR, represent ETR.

We created this code because we believe that articulating our values and obligations to one another reinforces the already exceptional level of respect among the team and because having a code helps provides us with clear avenues to quickly address issues should they arise and/or correct our culture should it ever stray from its expected  course.
