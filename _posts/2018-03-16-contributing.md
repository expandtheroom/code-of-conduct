A code of conduct is a step towards creating a better working environment, but itâ€™s not the last step. All members of ETR are encouraged to contribute to this code of conduct by talking with your manager or the leadership team to raise concerns they may have or share feedback. 

If you have a question or suggestion about these policies, provide as much context as you can. All changes and suggestions will be taken seriously and vetted by the leadership team, and, if necessary, by the legal department.
