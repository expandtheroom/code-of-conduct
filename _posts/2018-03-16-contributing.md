A code of conduct is a step towards creating a better environment for creativity, but it’s not the last step. Members of ETR are encouraged to contribute to this code of conduct by talking with your manager or the leadership team to raise a concern or share feedback. 

If you have a question or suggestion about these policies, provide as much context as you can. If you’ve spotted a typo, discriminatory language, or any other change which could be more expediently handled via a commit, go ahead and open a pull request. All changes and suggestions will be taken seriously and vetted by the leadership team, and, if necessary, by the legal department.
