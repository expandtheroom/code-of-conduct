These guidelines are ambitious, and we’re not always going to succeed in meeting them. When something happens—whether it’s a microaggression or an instance of harassment—there are a number of things you can do to address the situation with your fellow ETR team members or with your manager, or the leadership team. We know that you’ll do your best work if you’re happy and comfortable in your surroundings, so we take concerns about this stuff very seriously. 

Depending on your comfort level and the severity of the situation, here are some things you can do:

 **Address it directly.** If you’re comfortable bringing up the incident with the person(s) who instigated it, pull them aside to discuss how it affected you (and if you’re not comfortable approaching them, let your manager  know why. That’s important too). Try to approach these conversations in a forgiving spirit; an angry or tense conversation will not do either of you any good. The case may often be that the offending person had no idea they were at fault and will very much appreciate you bringing it to their attention. 

**Talk to a peer or mentor.** Your colleagues are likely to have personal and professional experience that could be of use to you. If you have someone you’re comfortable approaching, reach out and discuss the situation with them. They may be able to advise on how they would handle it or direct you to someone who can. The flip side of this, of course, is that you should also be available when your colleagues reach out to you. It’s key in these kinds
 of conversations, that nothing gets turned into gossip or fuels a rumor mill. 

**Talk to your manager.** Your manager probably knows quite a lot about the dynamics of your team and the company, which makes them a good person to look to for advice. They may also be able to talk directly to the colleague in question if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe doing so yourself. Your manager will be able to help you figure out how to ensure that any conflict with a colleague doesn’t interfere with your work.
