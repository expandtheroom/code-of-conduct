ETR is committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for everyone regardless of their gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, citizenship status, race, or religion. Discrimination and harassment are expressly prohibited.
<br><br><br>
Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
* Unsolicited comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, family, and hobbies.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “\*backrub\*”) without consent or after a request to stop. Be respectful of others’ personal boundaries and, if unsure, always default to no physical contact.
* Threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Stalking or following.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Photographing or recording a person without their knowledge or consent, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names (if you don’t know which pronouns someone uses, politely ask).
* Sustained interruptions or dismissals.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.

Much exclusionary behavior takes the form of microaggressions. These incidents are often considered too small to be reported but contribute to the pervasive and damaging feeling that the recipient is a lesser member of their industry or community. These are often unconsciously delivered, but regardless of intent, can have a significant negative impact and have no place on our team.
<br><br><br>
Some examples of microaggressions:

* Treating a female colleague differently than you would treat a male colleague in the same role.
* Expressing surprise or disbelief when a colleague contributes a good or productive idea. Along the same lines, implying that an accomplished or intelligent individual is somehow exceptional to their race or gender.
* Expecting a colleague to speak for their entire race, gender, or other group—e.g., asking someone to offer “the female perspective.”
* Assigning different labels to the same personality traits based on gender, e.g., a forceful, opinionated woman is labeled “bossy” where a man with the same qualities is “ambitious.”

Several behaviors that occur frequently in the tech industry are also worth calling out as specifically unwelcome.

* “Well, actuallys”—pedantic corrections that are often insulting and unproductive.
* Interrupting your colleagues while they are speaking.
* With rare exception, multitasking during a conversation rather than giving the speaker your full attention is counterproductive. In you find yourself in a meeting you are not giving or receiving value from, consider politely leaving that meeting.
* Responding with surprise or disdain when someone asks for help, and patronizing colleagues when giving that help. 
* Assuming complete and unfailing knowledge of a topic, even when your conversation partner is equally or more knowledgeable in that topic. 
* Excluding people from learning opportunities.
* Dismissing legitimate concerns about communication as the recipient being “too sensitive.” 
* Tone policing, described by Keith Bybee in *How Civility Works* as, “a means to deflect attention from injustice and relocate the problem in the style of the complaint, rather than address the complaint itself.”.
