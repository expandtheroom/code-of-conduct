ETR is committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for people regardless of their gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, citizenship status, race, or religion. Discrimination and harassment are expressly prohibited in our employee handbook.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
* Unsolicited comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “\*hug\*” or “\*backrub\*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained interruptions or dismissals.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.

Much exclusionary behavior takes the form of microaggressions. These incidents are often considered too small to be reported, but contribute to the pervasive and damaging feeling that the recipient is a lesser member of their industry or community. These are often unconsciously delivered, but regardless of intent, can have a significant negative impact and have no place on our team.

* Some examples of microaggressions:
* Treating a female colleague differently than you would treat a male colleague in the same role.
* Expressing surprise or disbelief when a minority colleague contributes a good or productive idea. Along the same lines, implying that an accomplished or intelligent individual is somehow exceptional to their race or gender - e.g. “he’s articulate for a black person” or “she’s pretty good for a female programmer.”
* Expecting a colleague to speak for their entire race or gender - e.g. asking someone to offer “the POC perspective” or “the female perspective.”
* Neglecting to use a person’s preferred gender pronouns (if you don’t know what someone’s pronouns are, ask. Or, listen for someone who knows the person well to use their pronoun).
* Assigning different labels to the same personality traits based on gender. E.g. a forceful, opinionated woman is labeled “aggressive” where a man with the same qualities is “ambitious.”
* Tone policing, or responding negatively or dismissively to the emotion behind a person’s message while ignoring its content (e.g. telling someone who is discussing an issue that makes them upset to “calm down” instead of responding to their concerns).

Several unwelcoming behaviors that occur frequently in the tech industry are worth calling out. These aren’t necessarily specific to treatment of minorities in tech, but cutting them out will go a long way towards making us all better people and communicators.

* “Well, actuallys”—pedantic corrections that are often insulting and unproductive.
* Interrupting your colleagues while they are speaking.
* Multitasking during a conversation rather than giving the speaker your full attention.
* Responding with surprise when someone asks for help, and patronizing colleagues when giving that help. 
* “Mansplaining,” or assuming complete and unfailing knowledge of a topic, even when your conversation partner is equally or more knowledgeable in that topic. Seriously, don’t be that person.
* Excluding people from learning opportunities.
* Dismissing legitimate concerns about communication as the recipient being “too sensitive.” 

Lastly, ExpandTheRoom prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The leadership team reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:

* ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia.’
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
* Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial.
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.
