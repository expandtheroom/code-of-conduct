Every member of ETR is expected to work hard, be considerate of their colleagues and our clients, and contribute to a collaborative, positive, and healthy environment.

**Be supportive of your colleagues, both proactively and responsively.** If you see someone struggling or otherwise in need of assistance, offer to help (without being patronizing or disrespectful). If someone approaches you looking for help, be generous with your time; if you’re under a deadline, direct them to someone else who may be of assistance or give them a clear timeframe of when you can help them. Leave the cliques in high school and unproductive  egos at the front door.

**Be collaborative.** Involve your colleagues in brainstorms, sketching sessions, code reviews, planning documents, and the like. It’s not only okay to ask for help or feedback often, it’s unacceptable not to do so. Don’t succumb to either impostor syndrome (believing that you don’t deserve to be here) or blowhard syndrome (believing you can do no wrong). Recognize that in addition to asking for feedback, you are similarly obligated to give it. 

**Be generous and kind in both giving and accepting feedback.** Feedback is a natural and important part of our culture. Good feedback is kind, respectful, clear, and constructive, focused on objective goals and requirements rather than personal preferences. You are expected to give and receive feedback with grace and always in service of producing the best work for our clients.

**Be respectful in remote and in-person interactions alike.** Our team is remote most of the time. While many of us live in or around New York City and can meet up in person easily, other equally important team members live far away. Adopt habits that are inclusive and productive for team members wherever they are: make liberal use of video conferences, document meetings and decisions thoroughly, record meetings when appropriate, be responsive, articulate, and concise in all communications and project management tools (i.e., email, Slack, Asana). Be mindful of time zones when scheduling events. Understand meetings are expensive and time-consuming.  Set meeting expectations clearly by writing up a thoughtful agenda, assigning topic leads and a timekeeper at the time of scheduling. During meetings, be mindful of and balance the length of the meeting against the material to be covered and getting everyone’s input. Only invite people that truly need to be in the meeting. Don’t become an organization who calls meetings to set up meetings about meetings that need to be scheduled. Leave that nonsense to the inefficient corporate world.  

**Be humane.** Be polite and friendly in all forms of communication - especially in non-verbal  communications, where opportunities for misunderstanding are greater. Use sarcasm carefully and exercise judgment in use of emojis. Tone is hard to decipher online; assume statements are made in good faith and clarify whenever possible. Use video conferences and in-person meetings when it makes sense, as face-to-face discussion benefits from all kinds of social cues that may go missing in other forms of communication. Over-communicate to make sure your intent is clear, and don’t allow tension from misunderstandings to build up.
