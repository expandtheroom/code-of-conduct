Every member of ETR is expected to work hard, be considerate of their colleagues, and contribute to a collaborative, positive, and healthy environment in which we can all succeed.

**Be supportive of your colleagues, both proactively and responsively.** If you see someone struggling or otherwise in need of assistance, offer to help (without being patronizing or disrespectful). If someone approaches you looking for help, be generous with your time; if you’re under a deadline, direct them to someone else who may be of assistance. Go out of your way to include people in team jokes or memes, and leave the cliques in high school where they belong.

**Be collaborative.** Involve your colleagues in brainstorms, sketching sessions, code reviews, planning documents, and the like. It’s not only okay to ask for help or feedback often, it’s unacceptable not to do so. Don’t succumb to either impostor syndrome (believing that you don’t deserve to be here) or blowhard syndrome (believing you can do no wrong). Recognize that in addition to asking for feedback, you are similarly obligated to give it. 

**Be generous and kind in both giving and accepting feedback.** Feedback is a natural and important part of our culture. Good feedback is kind, respectful, clear, and constructive, focused on objective goals and requirements rather than personal preferences. You are expected to give and receive feedback with grace.

**Be respectful in remote and IRL interactions alike.** Our team is remote most of the time. While many of us live in the same city and can meet up if needed, others live far from our colleagues. Adopt habits that are inclusive and productive for team members wherever they are: make liberal use of video hangouts, document meetings and decisions thoroughly, and be articulate and concise in email, Slack, and Asana exchanges. Be mindful of time zones and personal commitments (like picking up kids from school) when scheduling events. Set expectations for meetings by gathering the team’s input beforehand and writing up an agenda. During meetings, stop and ask if everyone has had a chance to speak up. 

**Be human.** Be polite and friendly in all forms of communication - especially remote communication, where opportunities for misunderstanding are greater. Use sarcasm carefully and exercise judgment in use of emojis. Tone is hard to decipher online; assume statements are made in good faith and clarify whenever possible. Use video hangouts and IRL meetings when it makes sense, as face-to-face discussion benefits from all kinds of social cues that may go missing in other forms of communication. Over-communicate to make sure your intent is clear, and don’t allow tension from misunderstandings to build up.
