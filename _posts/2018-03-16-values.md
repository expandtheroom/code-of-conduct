**We want our team to be a fun, productive, and safe space for all members.** In addition to core values of respect and honesty, there are several ways in which ETR distinguishes itself.

**We strive for a unified team where we can all learn from each other.** We maintain open lines of communication and foster good working relationships and friendships with one another. Collaboration is core to our success.

**We believe in diversity, not merely because it’s a mechanism for happier, more productive teams, but because we believe we have an obligation to work against structural discrimination.** This obligation manifests itself in myriad ways—hiring and promotion policies, community outreach, and in our own culture—in which this code of conduct plays a critical role.
