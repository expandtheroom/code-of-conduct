ETR is powered by its principles. Just as our design framework, <a href="https://expandtheroom.com/purpose-driven-design/" target="_blank">Purpose-Driven Design</a>, guides how we work and how we approach our projects, this code of conduct should guide us in our interactions with our colleagues.

We demand respect and honesty. We want our team to be a fun, productive, and a safe space for all members. We support diversity and believe it creates more informed, productive teams. While we recognize that no one organization can single-handedly do away with bias and prejudice in the workforce, we can make an impact by always hiring the best person for the role, regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, background, political or religious beliefs. We must also constantly monitor our own internal culture.

Above all, we strive to be a unified team where we can all learn from each other. We maintain open lines of communication and foster good and friendly working relationships with one another. Collaboration is core to our success, so we commit to evolving and improving this code with the help of our team as we learn and grow together.
