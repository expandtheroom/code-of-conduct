We believe in respect and honesty. We want our team to be a fun, productive, and safe space for all members. We believe in diversity not merely because it creates happier, more productive teams, but because we believe that structural discrimination is a problem that needs to be solved. While we recognize that no one organization can single-handedly do away with discrimination, we can make an impact by adopting mindful hiring and promotion policies, engaging in meaningful community outreach, and monitoring our own internal culture.

Above all, we strive for a unified team where we can all learn from each other. We maintain open lines of communication and foster good working relationships and friendships with one another. Collaboration is core to our success - so we commit to evolving and improving this code with the help of our team as we learn and grow together.
